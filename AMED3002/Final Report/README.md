This was the final report that we had to do in AMED3002: Interrogating Biomedical and Health Data. An interdisciplinary subejct that had data students group up with medical science students.


The project required us to find a study that dealt with gene expression and attempt to replicate some graphs and figures to test the papers reproducability.
We had to use techniques such as volcano plots, hierarchical clustering, SVM, random forest, and an indivudual section which required us to implement a 10-fold cross validation.
