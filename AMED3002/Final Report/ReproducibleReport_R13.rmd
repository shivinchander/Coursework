# Summary

## Aim

The aim of this study conducted by Wang and colleagues was to use both transcriptomic databases and SVM-based pattern recognition to select biomarkers that could be used in predicting and preventing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) as well as determine links, if any, to other correlating diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes and immune disorders.

## Methods

The study first screened 63 samples (32 GDM patient samples, 31 control samples) from a dataset collected from GEO (GSE70493) for GDM-specific biomarkers.  The study then utilized the edgeR package to screen out the differentially expressed genes between the two groups.  The paper then proceeded to use the Poisson regression model and Empirical Bayes method to account for biological variability and improve the overall reliability of future inferences.  

Hierarchical clustering was then performed to create a heatmap expressing the gene expression data analysis, and a volcano plot was created in order to observe the significance of the microarrays gene selection criteria.  Through the use of databases such as DAVID (database for annotation, visualization, and integration discovery) and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes), a gene regulatory network was then constructed in order to select GDM biomarker candidates (utilizing prior literature sourced from PubMed).  

Once biomarker candidates were located, all were subjected to the implementation of a SVM (support vector machine) to determine the prediction capacity of the model.  Finally, a 10-fold cross validation was performed to determine the validity of the study's findings and observe the error rate.

## Results

A total of 6 genes were found to serve as good predictors of GDM and thus have the potential to serve as biomarkers for GDM prediction and diagnosis.  The biomarkers found were all derived from the HLA superfamily - HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB5.  

# Experimental Design

The aforementioned methodologies of the paper can be split into 4 components:   
1. Obtaining of gene expression profiles    
2. Analysis of genes to narrow down potential biomarkers    
3. Obtaining of potential GDM biomarkers    
4. Creation of prediction models for validity   

## Workflow

knitr::include_graphics("Capture.png")
```

# Reproduced Report

## Load Data

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gset <- getGEO("GSE70493",getGPL=TRUE, destdir = ".")[[1]]
```

## Rename Pheno

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
exprs <- exprs(gset)
geneAnno <- fData(gset)
pheno <- pData(gset)
view(pheno)
colnames(pheno) <- gsub(" ", "_", colnames(pheno))
colnames(pheno) <- sub(":ch1", "", colnames(pheno))

x <- log2(exprs)
```

## Remove Missing Data

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Data <- na.omit(gset)
```

This was not explicitly stated that it was done in the current paper.  We decided to remove missing data anyway in order to get more accurate results/findings to compare to the original papers own findings.

## Creation of Design Matrix and Consequent Fits

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
design <- model.matrix(~pheno$gestational_diabetes, pheno)

fit = lmFit(x, design)
efit = eBayes(fit, trend = TRUE)

transpose <- t(x)
dt_fdr <- decideTests(efit, method = "hierarchical", p.value = 0.05)
summary(dt_fdr)
```

This was an interesting finding within our reproduced report as within the paper, they stated that they found 156 downregulated and 33 upregulated probes, making it a total of 189 differentially expressed probes.  In our report, we instead found 1,257 downregulated and 1,218 upregulated probes - obviously very different from the original.  

Unfortunately, the methods section was not explicit enough to state how they got these probes narrowed down and thus we could not replicate it to the full extent.  This, however, is an improvement on prior attempts made by members of the group, as previously we had found that none of the probes were significant, which would have been less helpful then our current findings.

It is important to note that the paper also made use of both the Poisson regression model and Empirical Bayes method.  Whilst we did use Empirical Bayes Method, as can be seen in the above coding, we decided not to use Poisson regression model as there was no impact of applying it to the data.  This was confirmed by a demonstrator during a 1-on-1 session.

## Hierarchical Clustering and Heatmap

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Hierarchical Clustering

library(pheatmap)
sampleInfo <- pData(gset)
gene_matrix <- cor(exprs(gset),use="c")

pheatmap(gene_matrix,
     labels_row = geneAnno$probeset_id,
     scale="row")
```

The study created its heatmap from utilising a dendrogram created from hierarchical clustering.  This was done by isolating the differentially expressed genes that had a p-value of less than 0.05 using edgeR.  Unfortunately, their methodologies on how this was performed (especially with a dataset with 70,000 probes) was unavailable.  

After multiple attempts of trying to minimise the list of genes utilised and expressed on the heatmap, we were unable to reproduce this exactly, finding that methodologies which could do this successfully online utilised prior versions of rStudio which we did not have access to.  Furthermore, it was not explicitly stated which form of hierarchical clustering was used within the data analysis.

Instead, we chose to create a heatmap, showing a different part of the data available.  The above heatmap shows a comparison of the probeset IDs and samples, with the colour scheme representing the expression levels of the differentially expressed genes, as found on the design matrix created.  Orange represents high expression levels and blue represents low expression levels.

## Volcano Plot

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
-log10(0.05)

top100DE <- rownames(dt_fdr)[1:100]
top19DE <- rownames(dt_fdr)[1:19]
columnColour = pheno$gestational_diabetes
columnColour[pheno$gestational_diabetes == "Yes"] = "red"
columnColour[pheno$gestational_diabetes == "No"] = "white"
useColumns <- !is.na(columnColour)


```


## DAVID and KEGG

The manuscript, after these initial differential analyses, performed both an enrichment analysis via the DAVID tool and constructed a KEGG pathway network in order to create a gene regulatory network - in other words, create gene symbols to replace the gene IDs provided in the initial dataset.

For our reproduced report, we did not make use of the DAVID database as upon inspection it required all 70,000 probes to be manually typed in to observe the gene IDs.  Furthermore, the KEGG pathway could also not be conducted due to the paper not being explicit in its use and contribution to the final results.

## SVM

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tab <- topTable(efit, coef = 2, adjust = "fdr", n = 10)
labCol <- c("Yes", "No")
top10 <- topTable(efit)

X <- t(exprs[rownames(top10), ])  # removed colnames[design] // wasnt needed

# Select outcome variable.
Y <- as.factor(pheno[, "gestational_diabetes"]) # as above, removed colnames[design] from left of comma

# test <- factor(rep(NA, n), levels = c("No", "Yes")) # dont need :(

# create new dataset.
gset1 <- data.frame(Y, X)

fit <- svm(Y ~ ., gset1)

predSVM <- predict(fit, gset1)  # Here we have predicted the classes of our original data.

mean(predSVM != gset1$Y) # value of 0.1269841
```

The current paper utilised a support vector machine (SVM) to predict the potential application of the 6 found biomarkers in GDM clinical diagnosis.  Through the creation of a test set and training set containing these particular data points, the study was able to obtain an error rate of 29.03%.  In our reproduction of this prediction model, we got an error rate of 17.4%, which gives the impression that the dataset is not as accurate as what would typically be ideal within the scientific community.  Despite this, it was still a better error rate than the original report, which leads to questions regarding the methodology within the paper and whether it misled our interpretation.

## randomForest

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(randomForest)
fit <- randomForest(Y ~ ., gset1)
predrandomForest <- predict(fit, gset1)  
predrandomForest <-factor(predrandomForest, levels = c("No", "Yes"))
predrandomForest
gset1$Y

table(predrandomForest)
table(gset1$Y)

mean(predrandomForest != gset1$Y)

## Gave us zero so we do this...

set.seed(51773)
n <- nrow(gset1)
trainTest <- rep(c("train", "test"), 100)
trainTest <- trainTest[1:n]
trainTestSample <- sample(trainTest, n, replace = FALSE)
dataTrain <- gset1[trainTestSample == "train", ]
dataTest <- gset1[trainTestSample == "test", ]

fitforest <- randomForest(Y ~ ., dataTrain)
predrandomForest <- predict(fitforest, dataTest)
mean(predrandomForest != dataTest$Y)
```

To test the data provided using another prediction model, we decided to use randomForest.  RandomForest can process a mixture of numerical and categorical features and does not require the data to be scaled, which is to our advantage since we had over 70,000 probes to process. Our findings indicated an error rate of 48.3%, which was greater than that found using the SVM model. Due to the high rate of error, this shows that the paper may have been misleading in its findings, this suggestion supported by the issues we found throughout the methodology component.

# Appropriateness

## Methods

The study was able to successfully determine 6 biomarkers that could be used clinically in the diagnosis of GDM, thus achieving their goal, thus indicating that their methodology served its purpose and was correct in order to give the provided outcome.  The methodology of utilising the DAVID database and KEGG pathway tools was found to be inappropriate as these programs were found to be inaccessible and difficult to use, especially when there was a requirement to manually insert the 70,000 probes - which in our time frame, was an unreachable goal.

Furthermore, there are doubts as to whether the methods have sufficient explanation in order to be reproducible for peer-reviews.  So despite their benefit and success within this paper, it cannot be stated with confidence that the methods were appropriate due to the lack of reproducibility. 

## Analysis

The analytical portion of the paper, particularly the SVM prediction model and 10-fold cross validation were for the most-part appropriate as they allowed for the determination of the validity of the model created within the study.  For the prediction model, SVM is not the most appropriate choice for analysis due to the large scale of the data.  Prediction models such as randomForest are better equipped for such datasets and thus would have potentially given a more accurate error rate and overall perspective of the predictive model created for the six biomarkers.

In regards to the 10-fold cross validation, we believe that this was an appropriate analytical method, as it provides the study with greater accuracy as to the fitting procedure as well as reduces both the variance and bias.  Therefore, deciding to use a 10-fold cross validation over a 5-fold is ideal in this scenario.

# Successes and Difficulties

## Successes

Despite our difficulties in extrapolating and reproducing this paper, we did have some successes.  Our group was able to understand the methodologies used, despite not being able to reproduce them, and follow the line of reasoning as to why the paper made these decisions.  Furthermore, we were able to reproduce, though not accurately, the SVM prediction model as well as implement our own randomForest classifier to compare the error rates.  Additionally, we were able to utilise the dataset and formulate our own heatmaps and volcano plots.  These may have not been reproduced from the paper, but it was able to show that we understood the data well enough to extract different variables from it to analyse.

## Difficulties

As evident from the above reproduced report, we encountered many difficulties with the paper.  One of our greatest weaknesses in reproducing the report was some of the databases and programs utilised by the paper, such as DAVID and KEGGS, which were difficult and too time-consuming to utilise as intended by the paper.  In turn, this meant that we were unable to create gene symbols within our reproduced report, which led to many difficulties later on in the paper.  Additionally, we had difficulty in reproducing many components of the report due to the ambiguous nature of the writing.  There was a lack of sufficient detail that would typically be required in order to reproduce someones findings in the case of peer-reviews.  This may have been due to the fact that this dataset was not created by the authors of the paper we looked at, rather they used another papers dataset and created their own interpretation of the findings through analytical methods on rStudio.  This could have led to a mis-translation within the methods section, thus making it difficult to reproduce.

overall, whilst a difficult paper to reproduce, we have learnt a lot about the difficulties of data analysis and interpretation, especially with such large datasets.  It can be difficult to manage and organise, as well as interpret.  This project has given all team members a great appreciation for the complexities of such work.

## Improvements to Workflow

Potential improvements to the workflow would include the use of other programs within rStudio rather than DAVID and KEGG to avoid unneccessary complexities within the methodology of extracting information from the provided dataset.  Whether this be through re-working the existing dataset to create subsets or creating a clear pathway to extracting the necessary gene symbols in order for the subsequent coding and findings to be parallel to that of the paper.

# INDIVIDUAL - 10-Fold Cross Validation (Method Utilised in Paper) - Shivin Chander

The paper uses a 10-Fold Cross Validation. 
Using certain cross validation techniques such as single hold out uses a certain percent of the data as training and the rest as the test set. For example, using 90% for training and 10% for testing, the test set is small and can therefore have large amounts of variation in the estimates for different samples of the data due to only fitting the data one time.
10-fold validation helps reduce this variance by training on a random sample of 90% of the data and testing on the remaining 10% 10 times and averaging out the results. Additionally, by using k-fold cross validation, different partitioning of the dataset can be taken to form k sub-sets and then averaged. This method can further increase the robustness of the model.
It should be noted that all steps of the model fitting must be performed independently for each fold to reduce bias.
